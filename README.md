A Java GUI application that is similar to Microsoft Paint in which the user can draw shapes, lines and text. The application has a slider in which text can be increased by size and the color can be changed by using Jcolorchooser. The stroke of lines can be made thicker with the slider and the color can be changed. Shapes can be made bigger by the slider and the color can be changed as well. There is an option to reset your board as well.
